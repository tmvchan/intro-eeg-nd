    "This is by no means an exhaustive introduction to how the Python coding language works, or all the funky things you can do with Jupyter. Heck, even I don't know them all! Needless to say, some of you might know way more about Python than I do. But if you are like me, and entered into the world of Python semi-blind, this is hopefully for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about coding is that even if you don't know a coding language, or know all the intricacies of how things work, if you know the basics and how to search up the relevant info, you can go a long way. Since Python is a free coding language that is very popular, knowing just a little bit will be super handy. if you've worked in the stats language R, you'll know a bit of that relevant info too.\n",

    "Jupyter is a way to document and run code alongside descriptions and graphs. Normally, you write a programming file and run it in a terminal, but with Jupyter, you can run it in a block. We'll dive into the programming files themselves, but first, we'll orient ourselves to Jupyter.\n",
